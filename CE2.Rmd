# Problem 1: Regression [6 points]

```{r}

**Q1**: Would choose logprice as response since it is 

**Q2:** What is the predicted price of a diamond weighting 1 carat. Use the closest 20% of the observations.  
**Q3:** What choice of $\beta_1$, $\beta_2$ and $K_{i0}$ would result in KNN-regression?  

**Q4:** Describe how you can perform model selection in regression with AIC as criterion.  
**Q5:** What are the main differences between using AIC for model selection and using cross-validation (with mean squared test error MSE)?  
**Q6:** See the code below for performing model selection with `bestglm()` based on AIC. What kind of contrast is used to represent `cut`, `color` and `clarity`? Write down the final best model and explain what you can interpret from the model.  
**Q7:** Calculate and report the MSE of the test set using the best model (on the scale of `logprice`).  

```{r,eval=FALSE}
library(bestglm)
ds=as.data.frame(within(dtrain,{
  y=logprice    # setting reponse
  logprice=NULL # not include as covariate
  price=NULL    # not include as covariate
  carat=NULL    # not include as covariate
  }))
fit=bestglm(Xy=ds, IC="AIC")$BestModel
summary(fit)
```

**Q8:** Build a model matrix for the covariates `~logcarat+cut+clarity+color+depth+table+xx+yy+zz-1`. What is the dimension of this matrix?  
**Q9:** Fit a lasso regression to the diamond data with `logprice` as the response and the model matrix given in Q8. How did you find the value to be used for the regularization parameter?  
**Q10:** Calculate and report the MSE of the test set (on the scale of `logprice`).  

**Q11:** A regression tree to model is built using a _greedy_ approach. What does that mean? Explain the strategy used for constructing a regression tree.  
**Q12:** Is a regression tree a suitable method to handle both numerical and categorical covariates? Elaborate.  
**Q13:** Fit a (full) regression tree to the diamond data with `logprice` as the response (and the same covariates as for c and d), and plot the result. Comment briefly on you findings.  
**Q14:** Calculate and report the MSE of the test set (on the scale of `logprice`).  

**Q15:** Explain the motivation behind bagging, and how bagging differs from random forest? What is the role of bootstrapping?  
**Q16:** What are the parameter(s) to be set in random forest, and what are the rules for setting these?  
**Q17:** Boosting is a popular method. What is the main difference between random forest and boosting?  
**Q18:** Fit a random forest to the diamond data with `logprice` as the response (and the same covariates as before). Comment on your choice of parameter (as decribed in Q16).   
**Q19:** Make a variable importance plot and comment on the plot. Calculate and report the MSE of the test set (on the scale of `logprice`).  

**Q20:** Finally, compare the results from c (subset selection), d (lasso), e (tree) and f (random forest): Which method has given the best performance on the test set and which method has given you the best insight into the relationship between the price and the covariates?


# Problem 2: Unsupervised learning [3 points]

**Q21:** What is the definition of a principal component score, and how is the score related to the eigenvectors of the matrix ${\hat {\bf R}}$. 

**Q22:** Explain what is given in the plot with title "First eigenvector". Why are there only $n=64$ eigenvectors and $n=64$ principal component scores?

**Q23:** How many principal components are needed to explain 80% of the total variance in ${\bf Z}$? Why is `sum(pca$sdev^2)=p`?  

**Q24**: Study the PC1 vs PC2 plot, and comment on the groupings observed. What can you say about the placement of the `K262`, `MCF7` and `UNKNOWN` samples? Produce the same plot for two other pairs of PCs and comment on your observations.


```{r}
library(ElemStatLearn)
X=t(nci) #n times p matrix
table(rownames(X))
ngroups=length(table(rownames(X)))
cols=rainbow(ngroups)
cols[c(4,5,7,8,14)] = "black"
pch.vec = rep(4,14)
pch.vec[c(4,5,7,8,14)] = 15:19

colsvsnames=cbind(cols,sort(unique(rownames(X))))
colsamples=cols[match(rownames(X),colsvsnames[,2])] 
pchvsnames=cbind(pch.vec,sort(unique(rownames(X))))
pchsamples=pch.vec[match(rownames(X),pchvsnames[,2])]

Z=scale(X)

pca=prcomp(Z)
plot(pca$x[,1],pca$x[,2],xlab="PC1",ylab="PC2",pch=pchsamples,col=colsamples)
legend("bottomright",legend = colsvsnames[,2],cex=0.55,col=cols,pch = pch.vec)

plot(1:dim(X)[2],pca$rotation[,1],type="l",xlab="genes",ylab="weight",main="First eigenvector")
```

**Q25:**: Explain what it means to use Euclidean distance and average linkage for hierarchical clustering. 

**Q26:**: Perform hierarchical clustering with Euclidean distance and average linkage on the scaled gene expression in `Z`. Observe where our samples labelled as K562, MCF7 and `UNKNOWN` are placed in the dendrogram. Which conclusions can you draw from this?

**Q27:**: Study the R-code and plot below. Here we have performed hierarchical clustering based on thefirst 64 principal component instead of the gene expression data in `Z`. What is the difference between using all the gene expression data and using the first 64 principal components in the clustering? We have plotted the dendrogram together with a heatmap of the data. Explain what is shown in the heatmap. What is given on the horizontal axis, vertical axis, value in the pixel grid?

```{r}
library(pheatmap)
npcs=64 
pheatmap(pca$x[,1:npcs],scale="none",cluster_col=FALSE,cluster_row=TRUE,clustering_distance_rows = "euclidean",clustering_method="average",fontsize_row=5,fontsize_col=5)
```

# Problem 3: Flying solo with diabetes data [6 points]

```{r}
flying=dget("https://www.math.ntnu.no/emner/TMA4268/2019v/data/flying.dd")
ctrain=flying$ctrain
ctest=flying$ctest
```

**Q28:** Start by getting to know the _training data_, by producing summaries and plots. Write a few sentences about what you observe and include your top 3 informative plots and/or outputs.

**Q29:** Use different methods to analyse the data. In particular use 

* one method from Module 4: Classification
* one method from Module 8: Trees (and forests)
* one method from Module 9: Support vector machines and, finally
* one method from Module 11: Neural networks

For each method you 

* clearly write out the model and model assumptions for the method
* explain how any tuning parameters are chosen or model selection is performed
* report (any) insight into the interpretation of the fitted model
* evaluate the model using the test data, and report misclassifiation rate (cut-off 0.5 on probability) and plot ROC-curves and give the AUC (for method where class probabilities are given).

**Q30:** Conclude with choosing a winning method, and explain why you mean that this is the winning method.
